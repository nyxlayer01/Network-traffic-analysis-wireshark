Wireshark Packet Capture & Protocol Analysis Report
---------------------------------------------------

Objective:
To capture live network packets, filter them by protocol, and identify different protocols in use.

Steps Performed:
1. Installed and opened Wireshark.
2. Selected the active network interface and started capture.
3. Visited https://www.wikipedia.org in the browser to generate traffic.
4. Stopped the capture after approximately one minute.
5. Applied display filters:
   - dns
   - tcp
   - http
6. Opened Statistics â†’ Protocol Hierarchy to view protocol breakdown.
7. Exported the capture as capture.pcap.

Protocols Identified:
1. DNS (Domain Name System)
   - Purpose: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
   - Observation: DNS lookups for wikipedia.org and related subdomains.
   - Packet Count: 36 packets

2. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
   - Purpose: Provides reliable, ordered delivery of data between applications.
   - Observation: TCP handshake and data transfer for HTTP requests.
   - Packet Count: 35 packets

3. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
   - Purpose: Transfers web content between client and server.
   - Observation: GET request to Wikipedia homepage.
   - Packet Count: 14 packets

Additional Observations:
- TCP packets included both handshake and HTTP content delivery.
- DNS queries resolved additional Wikimedia content delivery network domains.

Conclusion:
The capture demonstrated multiple network protocols in action while visiting Wikipedia, including DNS for name resolution, TCP for reliable data transport, and HTTP for delivering web content.
